# How to Ask Questions

## TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read)
The instructors won't be answering questions in-person this week. Instead, we'll be responding to Github issues on the `pbj-project2` repository during business hours.

Issues should follow this format:
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.

[Just click this handy link to create an issue with these blanks inserted for you!](For an example: [sample issue](https://github.com/ga-dc/pbj-project2/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.)

## Why?
Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Some times, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

## How?
Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue. It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help on Github.

## Context
When submitting an issue provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What User Story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

## What have you tried?
Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

## Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

## So when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?
When you've submitted an issue, and have spent more than 15 minutes trying to solve the problem yourself, 15 minutes Googling, and 15 minutes asking others for help in-person.

We really want to talk to you when it's an emotional or mental issue, more than a technical issue.
