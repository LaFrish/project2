# Presentations

In place of doing science-fair-style or one-by-one presentations, you will prepare a short (3 -5 minute) presentation which you will record and upload to YouTube. We'll watch the presenations on Friday morning - with popcorn!

### Hard Requirements

Your video must include:

- A website or e-mail address through which you can be contacted. This can be included either in the video itself or as the video description (the text beneath YouTube videos).
- A description and demo of your app
- A code sample explaining one thing you’re proud of
- One thing you’d do differently next time
- The next feature you’d implement if you had more time

### Submission deadline: Thursday, August 6th, 11:00pm

"But instructors, I won't be done with my project by then!"

That's OK! The people viewing your video don't have to know that. Show off what does work!

### Recording a video

You may use any video-recording mechanism you wish. QuickTime Player is in the Applications folder of your Mac. Notice that if you go to the "File" menu you can create a "New Screen Recording"! This collects audio as well; it's how instructors screencast lessons. You can then save the movie to your desktop and e-mail it.

If you're feeling really fancy, you can use iMove -- also in your Applications folder -- to doctor your movie. However, this is should be a priority far below actually completing your project -- having a swanky-looking video isn't on the rubric!

Alternatively, you can also create a video using YouTube's own built-in recorder, which also makes it easy to add basic effects, background music, and text to your videos. If you have a GMail account you also have a YouTube account. Just go to https://www.youtube.com/dashboard

### How to submit

Include a link to your video as an issue on **this** repository.
