# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application
## *Currently undergoing revisions for WDI-7*
### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Rails app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we've given you the tools over the past few weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. You may work from home, except for mandatory one-on-ones with your pod instructor.

We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. 
Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! 
**Please reference the [schedule](schedule.md)** to know what is due when!
Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals - scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** with **at least 1 association** (more if they make sense) - one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app.
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
* **Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data.
* Have **semantically-clean and validating HTML and CSS**. (See "Resources" below)
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** in the root of your repo, with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **A `planning` folder** in the root of your repo, inside of which is...
  * A `wireframes` directory, inside of which are *at least* 2 photos or drawings of wireframes
  * A `user_stories.md` file, containing at least 7 user stories, *or* a link to Trello with at least 7 user stories.

### Tips

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don't hesitate to write throw away code to solve short term problems**. When we say "throw away", we mean **commit**, **then** throw it away. **Never ever just delete code such that it can't be retrieved.**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what ot build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Cheerups
The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

##### Bookmarket
You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

##### Photo sharing app
Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners. Users will be able to view other users' albums. Maybe users can comment on photos, or either up/down vote them. (Please note: file uploading is *difficult* and memory-intensive. We encourage you to use a separate image uploading service -- Imgur, Flickr, etc -- and for your app to store only the URLs of those images, rather than the images themselves.)

##### Anything Else!

You're not limited to the above ideas, feel free to come up with your own idea. Just make sure to run it by your instructor to make sure the idea is feasable to finish during project week.
